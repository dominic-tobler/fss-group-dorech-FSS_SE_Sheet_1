# The following option can be used to install a specific commit of transformers from GitHub
# -e git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@8ac2b916b042b1f78b75c9eb941c0f5d2cdd8e10#egg=transformers
# Would be better to use that I guess since it doesn't require the transformers folder to be in the repo from the get go, but since the assingment specifically asks to clone the repo, we go with the editable local install instead:
-e ./transformers
